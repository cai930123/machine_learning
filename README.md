# machine-learning
This project is for predicting variation of stock price in the future. using keras with tensorflow in the backend. 

## Project Purpose

stock prediction is one of the most concerning question. This project wants to find a good machine learning method on predicting future stock price variation. This may help to evaluate whether a stock is worth investing.
